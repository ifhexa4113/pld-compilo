# PLD Compilo
Compiler for a C subset - School project

## Prerequisites
### About Windows
Flex and Bison are not really easy to build with windows.
Fortunately, there is a great package called
[Win flex-bison](https://github.com/lexxmark/winflexbison)
that will let you install both directly,
or build it through Visual Studio 2010 and higher.

Take a look at [this documentation](https://sourceforge.net/p/winflexbison/wiki/Visual%20Studio%20custom%20build%20rules/)
for more information.

### Flex
Flex is a fast lexical analyzer generator.

You'll need the [Flex utility tool](https://github.com/westes/flex/releases).
2.6.3 is the current version at the time of this project.
Also, be sure to add it to your path!

_For windows, this may be complicated. See the previous section_.

### Bison
> Bison is a general-purpose parser generator that converts
a grammar description for an LALR(1) context-free grammar
into a C program to parse that grammar.

You'll find it [here](https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/).
To install it, [this documentation](https://geeksww.com/tutorials/miscellaneous/bison_gnu_parser_generator/installation/installing_bison_gnu_parser_generator_ubuntu_linux.php)
may help.
Also, be sure to add it to your path!

_For windows, this may be complicated.
See the previous section called **About Windows**_.

### Make
Be sure to have a GNU make installed (whether on *nix or a *nix-like environment
like cygwin or even directly on your windows)
and that the path to the executable is in your PATH variable.

### g++
By default, the project uses g++ as compiler with the flag `-std=gnu++11`.
Be sure that everything will work with it.

## Build and run
### Windows
```shell
git clone https://github.com/ifhexa4113/pld-compilo.git
cd pld-compilo
make
build\pld-compilo.exe
```

### *nix
```shell
git clone https://github.com/ifhexa4113/pld-compilo.git
cd pld-compilo
make OS=unix
./build/pld-compilo.exe
```

### Make rules
* **all** (default): build the whole project.
* **makedir**: create build and bin folders and subfolders.
* **parser**: build the parser thanks to bison and flex.
* **build**: build the project assuming the parser has already been built.
* **run**: Build and run the project.
* **clean**: remove all .o files.
* **mrproper**: remove whole build folder.
* **print-%**: show a makefile variable. Example: `make print-DEBUG` -> `yes`

Notes:
* Any rule on *nix: `make <rule> OS=unix`
* Debug mode (default: yes): `make DEBUG=no`
* Change compiler (default: g++): `make CC=<your compiler>`

## About IDEs
### CLion
CLion natively uses CMake,
but you can easily tell CMake to make use of your local makefile
[like this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26918459/using-local-makefile-for-clion-instead-of-cmake).

### Visual studio
Visual studio doesn't let you use make directly in default projects,
but you can easily set it up to make it work.
[This link](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/txcwa2xx.aspx) will surely help.

## About make
No, make **doesn't** only work with Unix bash.
You can perfectly use it in your Windows console, without anything like cygwin.
Take a look at [this link](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm).

## About compilers for this compiler
Of course, this project will use Regex,
which are a little buggy with some versions of **gcc** and **g++**.

At first sight, **Visual C(++)** and **Clang** look fine.
